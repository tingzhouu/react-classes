# JSX and React
This repository serves to document my learning of JSX and React. This is a very simple application to obtain the user's location, display a custom page for summer and winter accordingly. While waiting for user's location, a loading page with a spinner is added to make the less awkward. The purpose of this exercise is to use Class Components, States, Lifecycle Events in React. 

## What I Have Used

**React and JSX**
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

**Semantic UI CDN**
For styling of content such as loading page and icons.

**gh-pages**
To upload this project onto github pages.
